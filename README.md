## Discover India companies (OpenCorporates)

This demo can search Indian companies using the OpenCorporates public API. In the app choose "Discover India companies", enter a keyword or city (optional), set max results and click Search. The app will show registry data (company number, status, incorporation date, registered address) when available. Then click Enrich on any company to try scraping a website (if a domain exists or can be inferred).

Notes:
- OpenCorporates is free but rate-limited. Please do not overload the API.
- The app only attempts website scraping for contact info if a domain is available or can be inferred from the company name.
